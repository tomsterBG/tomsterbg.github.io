Hey, i'm `tomster` and i like tinkering with computers, but also i love knowledge, especially truth. The more the truth, the happier i become!

Since a kid my dad taught me to always think before my actions which helped transform me into a logical person who draws the line, sometimes too conservatively.

I love meeting people, talking with them and learning from what they say and from how they criticize me, because criticism is not a personal attack, it's a way to improve and i like improvement.

Ever since switching to [Linux Mint](https://www.linuxmint.com/) i've been using mostly [free open source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software). A very interesting observation was that, i used Windows before and had to give up on some of its apps and features, but most those were actually harmful to my health! For example, i no longer login to YouTube because the algorithm built up such a detailed profile about me, that i developed a binge watching addiction.
