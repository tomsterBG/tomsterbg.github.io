## Why bother making a blog?

An [old man](https://www.youtube.com/@DryCreekWranglerSchool) said to pass it on, share your knowledge and wisdom with the younger generation. (and [here](https://youtu.be/IbqUTHHRMn4&t=1064) he talks how it's a crime to have a wealth of knowledge and not pass it on) I am young, green and still have nothing to pass on, but i want to share the little that i currently have. I just really want to help people, but also belive that it'll help me.

do to others what you would have them do to you (Matthew 7:12)

I like helping people, that makes me happy, and the way i can help is by using my skills - writing, programming, logical reasoning. Early on in my life dad showed me what programming is, and i've tried some other skills, but no other stuck with me as much as programming. So here i am, programming [my own](https://github.com/tomsterbg/tomsterbg.github.io) blog website because i can, and i want. And the reason i can is because [this gigachad](https://brainfucksec.github.io/) made it super easy!

When i see what is going on in the world, how delusional some people are, i want to speak. And my message here is that, if most people who reject thinking actually start doing it, they'll suddenly see an improvement in their life. For example an online friend of mine came recently saying how she likes to be called with pronouns `he/him`. It's a girl, so logically she'd be lying if she said she's a man. But oh well, certain media, certain parties and underlying puppeteers decided to divide and conquer, and that's what they do. They filled up her head with nonsense. Nobody would say "this chicken is male" because we all know, roosters are male üêì‚ôÇÔ∏è, chickens are female üêî‚ôÄÔ∏è, but somehow people say "it's fine that she likes to have male pronouns" ‚ôÄÔ∏è->‚ôÇÔ∏è? Thankfully not *that* many people, as she told me this choice made her lose way too many friends, but i'm here, i'll stick around and see how i can help. Don't abandon the few friends you have over things like this, people need connections.

## Who are you to teach me?

Correct. I can't just teach you something i haven't understood nor experienced personally. Every time i did that, it was a big mistake and i hated what i'd posted online. This is why i'll try to focus more on my stories, my experiences, what i did, what really happened to real people, just to give a real, meaningful example and not empty words.

Often times these blog sites write a lot and say nothing, empty words. I want to write a lot and say a lot. I want each sentence to be meaningful and real, to be there with a purpose and a story that backs it up. And i will edit posts, ackgnowledge mistakes and criticism, and change whatever needs changing, while i have access to [this blog's source](https://github.com/tomsterbg/tomsterbg.github.io). Because it's not perfect, it will never be perfect, our world isn't perfect. Nobody should ever claim to have made anything perfect in an imperfect world.

Everything someone writes should be something they experienced.

While reading the Bible i noticed something interesting. Especially everything written since Jesus, the writings are by people who have first obtained experience and opened their own eyes and only then wrote to open our eyes. This is why i have some deep topics i want to mention, but i will not publish them until they mature enough in my mind.

Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother‚Äôs eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? (Matthew 7:3)

I will at least try.

## Why not do this on YouTube?

I tried, but quickly realized that YouTube is very dangerous. All the tutorials and best practices on how to make successful content are about hiding who you are and filling the "niche gap". The entire platform psychology is made to motivate me based on video views and i hate it. I don't control views, why motivate me with something i have no control over? A successful YouTuber needs to be good at **selling ideas**, i don't want that. He needs to put on a mask and adapt to people's illogical and ever-changing desires, to fit in. This same pressure to fit in, in order to be successful is why we see no creativity in the content. It's all the same, just different coats of paint. Same what? I call this building material "empty noise".

YouTube is censorship hell and it feels much nicer, more rewarding and fun to develop a website on my own because i can do so much with it while my brain logically develops both in writing and programming. I can change how the entire thing looks! ... You don't have this level of freedom on YouTube.

## How dangerous is popularity?

Very dangerous.

When you start climbing the [ladder](https://www.reddit.com/r/satire/comments/1khe87/tale_of_the_stairway_translation_of_a_bulgarian/) ü™ú of popularity, things get really rough, real fast. (read the whole tale, please, it's super short and very well written, also [this](https://chitanka.info/text/4253-prikazka-za-stylbata) is the original, if you want to compare with ai translations)

Morally i feel like it's a major toll on my sould when i post something wrong or empty. If i know it has a mistake in it, i better fix the mistake. If it's empty, just delete it as much as you can. I don't want my work to be the reason people fall for traps, but it will, no matter what i do. There are some people who just take `1/10th` of the whole picture and "interpretate" it. Then when criticized for their wrong understanding, they don't say sorry and try to improve, they take the blue pill. "I am right to interpretate everything the way i like." Specifically for this kind of abuse of freedom, Bulgaria has a saying which can't be easily translated: "—Å–≤–æ–±–æ–¥–∞—Ç–∞ –Ω–µ –µ —Å–≤–æ–±–æ–¥–∏—è". However this Bible verse explains it pretty well:

‚ÄúI have the right to do anything,‚Äù you say ‚Äî but not everything is beneficial. ‚ÄúI have the right to do anything" ‚Äî but not everything is constructive. (1 Corinthians 10:23)

One main reason i stopped trying YouTube was popularity, its reach just goes too far and the whole point is to have as many numbers as possible. Why? ... Like for real, your company would grow, but... why? Will you buy two yachts instead of one? Will you give 1% to the homeless? Or will you invest for even more growth? The least moral and logical thing is to keep growing for the sake of growing, because you don't connect your growth to anything else, it's all the same empty growth and you feel it, yet that's what we see everywhere, reinvestment into growth with no greater moral goal in mind. You could spend a percent of your extra growth on fixing some major issues, but no, you want to grow. You have completely forgotten why by now. The rich don't belie when the poor say they're hungry.

Or, are you growing because of the leaderboard? "I am the 1723rd wealthiest man, let's strive for 1722 by the end of the week." If i was still at age 14 i'd say "Yeah, makes sense, i also want to see myself higher on the leaderboard." However as you grow up mentally and try to rise on the leaderboards, you realize that all this competition achieves nothing. Gamers will understand me because they've had a taste of it. Sure, the real thing is not a game, but they have at least one thing in common: that amazing feeling when you get it, "Yeah! I achieved it!" until it dries out very soon and you want *more*. Not to mention this incentivizes extremist levels of competition, which can get really toxic, yet there's no need for that. If you want to be happy and healthy, there's no way you'd logically look at this and think "Yeah, that's one way to achieve happiness!"

## Will i monetize?

Probably not. I don't feel like involving money into this. I want to perhaps use this to build a community, have some friends, people who'd like to help out, but i do not want to become dependent. This website's programming is free and it should remain free. Which is why i chose to [:license](https://tomsterbg.github.io/licensing-of-this-blog) it.

Currently this website has no analytics (even if it came with `commented out` google analytics, just waiting to be uncommented and then jump into action), no cookies, no tracking data, nothing and i have no intention on collecting, reviewing and selling any data either (other than reading your messages when you [contact](https://tomsterbg.github.io/contacts) me).

## Why am i brutally honest?

I want to be honest, but i find myself weak when trying to explain complex things in words. I forget, i mess up, it's just all over the place. That's why i write them instead. I am writing exactly what i would say, but the writing is more refined, i can say "oops" and edit things naturally while i can't just slip up every 5 seconds while talking to people. You know it too, that feeling when you just said something and want to unsay it because you instantly realized the mistake.
