## Why bother making a blog?

An [old man](https://www.youtube.com/@DryCreekWranglerSchool) said to pass it on, share your knowledge and wisdom with the younger generation. (and [here](https://youtu.be/IbqUTHHRMn4&t=1064) he talks how it's a crime to have a wealth of knowledge and not pass it on) I am young, green and still have nothing to pass on, but i want to share the little that i currently have. I just really want to help people, but also belive that it'll help me.

do to others what you would have them do to you (Matthew 7:12)

I like helping people, that makes me happy, and the way i can help is by using my skills - writing, programming, logical reasoning.

I just really want to help. My main skills are to think logically and use a keyboard. Early on in my life dad showed me what programming is, and i've tried some other skills, but no other came even close. So here i am, "programming" "my own" blog website because i can, and i want. I want because i feel like helping society, as if passing on my knowledge, my writing, my work, as if that'd somehow help at least one soul out there.

## Who are you to teach me?

Correct. This is why i am writing about anything in my personal notes, but i really, **really** have to ensure i don't talk about things i don't understand, nor have experienced yet. I am going to try my best to ONLY dive deep into personal stories of mine or ones from sensible sources. For example the Bible surprised me with just how real the stories are, how exactly truthful the way of talking is, because the ones who wrote the books had their eyes opened, they didn't write blind and i shouldn't either.

## Why not do this on YouTube?

I tried, but quickly realized that to be successful on YouTube requires a lot of finesse that i don't have. Finesse that needs me to hide who i am, to adapt to people's illogical and ever-changing desires, to comform to a platform. YouTube is censorship hell and it fells much nicer, more rewarding and fun to develop a website on my own because i can do so much with it. I can change how the entire thing looks, you don't have this level of freedom on YouTube.

I've been pondering a lot on some similar questions. The problem is, i have a major internal conflict. I know that the best choice is to be modest. Don't ask for popularity.
