The blog is coming together!

I just can't miss the opportunity to thank the person, thanks to whom i am doing this now: [brainfucksec](https://brainfucksec.github.io/), the "keep it stupid simple" ([KISS](https://brainfucksec.github.io/android-foss-apps-list-2025#introduction)) idea seems to have worked out wonderfully for him and made my experience while making this... *stupid simple* ðŸ˜‰

I spent two days looking around like a headless fly until realizing i can just copy [this](https://github.com/brainfucksec/brainfucksec.github.io) repository. And the funny thing is, i knew about it, it was the whole reason i was motivated to host a blog on GitHub pages, but all the other resources i found seemed bloated and complex.

How'd i know about it? I switched to [Linux Mint](https://www.linuxmint.com/) from Windows (best decision ever) and noticed it comes with Firefox. I dove deeper into browser privacy and found out i don't need other browsers if Firefox can be [hardened](https://brainfucksec.github.io/firefox-hardening-guide-2024). Thanks to this, i have been feeling WAY safer while browsing around, especially considering i used Chrome before.

Also here's a bit of related resources:
- <https://github.com/tocttou/tocttou.github.io> - another similar website
- <https://github.com/tocttou/hacker-blog> - the theme used by brainfucksec and tocttou

Additionally let's add some testing elements so i can more easily see how the scss theme works:
# H1
## H2
### H3
#### H4
##### H5
###### H6
my `inline | code`
```lua
and some --lua
local bring = 0, "string", nil
```

| and   | true | false |
| ----- | ---- | ----- |
| true  | 1    | 0     |
| false | 0    | 0     |
