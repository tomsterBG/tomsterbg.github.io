I have been making this website for the past few days and i have to admit, Gemini 2.5 has been VERY helpful!

Usually i am not an early adopter, i don't jump on beta versions nor look for the newest trends. I never pay online (did it once and it was a waste of money, never again) and i always look for free, stable software even if that means *looking for alternatives* üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è. Actually, ever since ditching Windows i haven't downloaded anything shady, well except GitHub Desktop (it's shady because GitHub is owned by Microsoft).

Also i've been on the skeptical side of the ai revolution. Not because i don't believe what is going on, i do see and use it, ai is great and useful! The skepticism is about how people wrongly interpret it, saying overly optimistic stuff because they heard the overpromised lies told by the giants who run these companies. Ai needs insane learning data and runtime, something only the giants can afford. Not to mention there are [stories](https://world.edu/long-hours-and-low-wages-the-human-labour-powering-ais-development/) of many people being used as very low wage workers to label data, that's... really dark. And i couldn't even find the one i remember so i linked to a different one.

Pro tip: you can `middle-click` the scroll on your mouse for various things. I use it for opening links in a new tab.


I remembered that i had seen [this website](https://brainfucksec.github.io/) earlier to harden my Firefox and when i saw the github.io url i thought "You can do that?" It wasn't until `4 May 2025` that i decided to actually look at this website's [GitHub repo](https://github.com/brainfucksec/brainfucksec.github.io) and that turned out to be the best decision ever! Thank you gigachad, your work will be remembered and loved!

So i started messing with my own copy of his website and asking Gemini to make edits and explain some things. I now remember this very important thing i had forgotten while programming - the best way to learn it past the basics is to read other people's code and try to understand and modify it. This is a very, *very* fast way to learn especially when combined with years of past experience (that are currently grayed out because i'm rusty, haven't been coding for a while) and with an ai that can, *FINALLY*, code like a half-competent person.

Gemini is still not at the point of replacing programmers, but it's definitely at the point where a client could come in, ask for some software and you'd prompt the ai to quickly whip up drafts that you could show to your customer for an easier time later. We all know that type of person who thinks they know what they want, but when they actually see what you do, they say "no, i wanted it more like this". That problem will still exist, but you can really alleviate it now with quick ai generated drafts.

## Basic structure
The website uses the simplest things possible: `.html`, `.scss`, `LiquidJS` (to be parsed in `.markdown`), `markdown` and i love this. Markdown is my favorite especially after using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for about a year now.

I love how you can write `HTML` and `LiquidJS` inside the same `markdown` file, as you can see in `root/posts.md`. One main complaint: i am using the default Linux Mint text editor with dark mode which makes most colored text a nightmare to read. I really don't want to use VSCode again, i found it really hard to understand what's going on and it feels sluggish.
