I am currently in the process of writing, refining and asking for criticism on this topic. It will change over time.

Since i want to write more in this blog, which is publicly visible, i have to ask this question.
I've been noticing some very important problems related to popularity and the internet.

One such problem is that some people tend to believe what they read. Others don't believe it until they see it in two or more different places. For example my mom constantly falls for various lies she read on random websites. I have also believed in lies multiple times.
