I am currently in the process of writing, figuring out and asking for criticism on this topic. It will change over time.

Since i want to write in this public blog, i have to ask some big questions.
I've been noticing some very important problems related to popularity and the internet.

One such problem is that some people tend to believe what they read. Others don't believe until they see the same info in two or more different places. For example my mom constantly falls for various lies she read on random websites. I have also believed in lies multiple times. I also fell for the false belief of "more popular = more trustworthy".
