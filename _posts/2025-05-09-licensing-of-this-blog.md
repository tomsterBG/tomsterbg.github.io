I want all my work to be legally free (as in freedom) so i'm replacing the original license i found here, Creative Commons ([README.md](https://github.com/brainfucksec/brainfucksec.github.io/blob/master/README.md) and [license.md](https://github.com/brainfucksec/brainfucksec.github.io/blob/master/license.md) both point to [CC0 1.0 Universal](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/deed.en), but [footer.html](https://github.com/brainfucksec/brainfucksec.github.io/blob/master/_includes/footer.html) links to [CC BY-NC 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/deed.en_US) so it's not even clear what i'm replacing) with [GNU GPL v3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html) because it says things like "you can't make hardware that prevents people from changing the software" ... *hmm* ü§îüçé. This license is the reason why Linux has remained free and open source for all these years.

GNU, whoever your people are, whatever you are doing, i love you for making this license ‚ô•Ô∏è
